My attempt at a Twitch IRC library for the Rust programming language, using the recently stabilized async rust traits/language features.

Example usage (This is the `simple_listener` example, see `examples/simple_listener.rs` and run it with `cargo run --example simple_listener`):

```rust
use twitch_irc::login::StaticLoginCredentials;
use twitch_irc::ClientConfig;
use twitch_irc::TCPTransport;
use twitch_irc::TwitchIRCClient;

#[tokio::main]
pub async fn main() {
    // default configuration is to join chat as anonymous.
    let config = ClientConfig::default();
    let (mut incoming_messages, client) =
        TwitchIRCClient::<TCPTransport, StaticLoginCredentials>::new(config);

    // first thing you should do: start consuming incoming messages,
    // otherwise they will back up.
    let join_handle = tokio::spawn(async move {
        while let Some(message) = incoming_messages.recv().await {
            println!("Received message: {:?}", message);
        }
    });

    // join a channel
    client.join("sodapoppin".to_owned());

    // keep the tokio executor alive.
    // If you return instead of waiting the background task will exit.
    join_handle.await.unwrap();
}
```

Current features:
- Connection pool, new connections will be made based upon load
  - Will create a new connection if all existing connections have already joined 90 channels (number is configurable)
  - Will create a new connection if all connections are currently busy (if it has recently sent a lot of messages and you risk a long delay from your messages being queued up server-side)
- Automatic reconnect of failed connections
- Automatically rejoins channels if connections fail
- Modern async interface
- Automatic rate limiting of new connections
- Supports automatic token refresh for tokens that are not infinitely lived (also supports infinitely lived tokens separately)
- Optionally exports metrics, using the `metrics` crate (Compatible with prometheus and many others).

TODO things:
- Implementation of twitch-imposed rate limits (PRIVMSG, Whisper)
- Support plaintext connections in addition to the TLS and WSS types already supported
